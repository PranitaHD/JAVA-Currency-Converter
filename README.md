# JAVA-Currency-Converter
Language :- Java Programming. In this program at very first, you have to choose an option from the OPTION list. Then you have to enter the amount you want to convert. At the end of the program, your amount will be converted into remaining all other options. Currencies in this program are : Rupee, Dollar, Pound, Euro, Yen and Ringgit. I have used NetBeans IDE here.
